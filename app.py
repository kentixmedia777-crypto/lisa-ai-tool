      "instruction": "IF the character is a MINOR/CHILD: STRICTLY AVOID 'selfie', 'close-up', 'messy', 'dirty', or 'imperfect' keywords applied to the child. SHIFT style to 'Candid photograph taken by an adult' or 'Family photo'. Use 'safe distance', 'wholesome', 'clean', and 'soft lighting' contexts.
